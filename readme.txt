== FAQ ==

= How does this plugin fix all the errors? =

We've written the code for this plugin in a completely PHP 5.3 compliant, Object Oriented, non-obfuscated way so that the detection of obstructed array methods will always pass through our normalize scripting processor. It is basically fool proof.

= I've activated the plugin but my site doesn't seem any better. Is something wrong? =

Most likely no. Try taking the following steps:

1. Reboot your computer
2. Clear your browser's cache
3. Navigate to your site's home page
4. Double click on the header and then on the footer

If that doesn't work, try deactivating and then reactivating the plugin.

= I kind of thought my site was betterified site was actually better? Should I just deactivate worserified? =

No.  Your betterified website was too much better, leave worserified activated

= How can I ever thank you? =

Don't thank me. Thank the person on the plugin review team who actually let this plugin on the repository.

= Is this plugin actually a placebo? =

Yes.
